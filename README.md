**Data pre-processing**

I completed this project as part of an assessed coding bootcamp with Imperial College London. The project demonstrates various methods for addressing missing values, data standardisation, and normalisation, which are essential steps in preparing data for machine learning or statistical analysis.

**Dataset:**

The project uses the 'balance_missing.txt' and 'countries.csv' datasets included.

**Key Techniques**

**Missing Data Handling:**

Identifying Missing Values: The code demonstrates using df.isnull().sum() to calculate the count of missing values (NaN) in each column.
Dropping Rows/Columns: The trade-offs of using .dropna() to remove rows or columns with missing values are discussed.
Imputation: Filling missing values with appropriate strategies:
Replacing with a constant (e.g., 0) using .fillna(0).
Forward/backward filling to propagate the last valid observation.
Interpolation to estimate based on surrounding values.
Imputation using the column's mean or median values.

**Scaling and Normalization:**

Min-Max Scaling: Data is transformed to a specific range (usually 0 to 1) with mlxtend.preprocessing.minmax_scaling(). This improves the convergence of many machine learning models.
Standardization (Z-score): Data is rescaled to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 with the mlxtend.preprocessing.standardize() function. This is often used when a dataset contains varying scales or potential outliers.

**Code Structure:**

The code provides clear examples of applying different preprocessing techniques on a sample dataset. Comments within the code explain the process and potential considerations for each method.
